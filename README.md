The main objectives of this project are to
- Save people’s time from waiting in long ticket line
- Increase human interaction with computer based digital system
- Ensure fixed ticket price all the time of the year

The main motivation for our project is-
In our era, people are always busy with their work. As a result, they don’t like wasting time in ticket buying
queue. Also, people tend to love to get service from home. So we are trying to reduce the hassle of buying
tickets from the bus counter by standing in a long queue.To solve the situation efficiently, we have created a
project that will help it’s users to buy bus tickets online.
